# Wanderings

Some Jupyter notebooks from learning, researching and exploring concepts in
machine learning, data science, quantitative finance... in short, the results of
my wanderings through different topics. This repository is full of rough and uncut
ideas (and yes, probably some garbage), but if you're lucky you might find
something that interests you.
